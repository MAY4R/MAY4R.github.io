# Welcome to My Blog Repo! ✨

Hey there! I'm Mayar, and this is the GitHub repository for my personal blog, where I share writeups, walkthroughs, and notes on machines and challenges I’m solving in the world of cybersecurity & penetration testing.

This blog is powered by the Chirpy Jekyll theme, and it's my little space to document learning, break down problems, and explore cool vulnerabilities — one challenge at a time.

Feel free to explore, learn, and connect!
